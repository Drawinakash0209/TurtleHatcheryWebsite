      <h2>Turtle Species of Sri Lanka</h2>
      <p>Five Sri Lanka is fortunate to have five of the seven live sea turtle species documented in the globe reported along the lovely coastline belt of the island - arriving for breeding. The "big five" include the Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Olive Ridley (Chelonia mydas), and Hawksbill (Lepidochelys olivacea). Therefore, if you arrange a beach vacation in Sri Lanka with the help of knowledgeable professionals like Mahoora Tented Camps Sri Lanka, you are almost certain to visit some! Now, if we examine each of these turtles individually:</p>

                      <p>Green turtles can weigh up to 230 kg and have an average length of 1 meter. All tropical and subtropical oceans, including the Indian, Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific Oceans, are home to this migratory fish. Green turtles are caught and killed to make the delicacy known as "turtle soup" in various cultures. Their English name alludes to the hue of the soup-making fat that can be discovered beneath their shells. The majority of young green turtles are carnivorous. The adults, on the other hand, are herbivores and only consume marine plants like sea grass and marine algae. Today, green turtles are regarded as a ''Endangered'' species.</p>
                <p>These turtles are known to lay their eggs in the Sri Lankan towns of Akurella, Mawella, Kosgoda, Rekawa, Ambalantota, Yala, and Bundala. They are extensively dispersed throughout tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the vicinity of oceanic islands and along shores with expansive sandy beaches. They can be found in all oceans with waters that are primarily temperate. In the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific waters, there is a sizable population.</p>

                        <p>Of all the sea turtles, the Olive Ridley is the smallest. The adults can reach a length of 65 cm and weigh less than 40 kg. The tropical Indian, south Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans are where they are most commonly found. They consume fish, crustaceans, and some marine vegetation because they are omnivore. Currently, Olive Ridley turtles are classified as a ''Endangered'' species. Olive Ridley turtles lay their eggs on a beach in a large group known as a "Arribada" in a few nations. The arrival is the meaning of this Spanish word. For instance, during the course of a few weeks, 600,000 Olive Ridley turtles have been observed breeding in India on the same beach.Olive Ridley turtles are in danger despite having what appear to be large populations. This is due to the fact that a large number of members of this species rely on the safety of a select few significant beaches for nesting.</p>

                      <p>
                        Loggerhead turtles can weigh up to 180 kg and reach lengths of 1 meter. This species builds its eggs on beaches in both tropical and temperate regions, including the Mediterranean and the South East coast of the United States. Despite being one of the most widespread species in the globe, this species is the least prevalent nesting species in Sri Lanka. It is crucial to take prompt conservation action to safeguard the Loggerhead turtles in Sri Lanka since they are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent, only lay their eggs there, and have distinctive coloration that suggests a distinct population with unique DNA. Loggerhead turtles eat mostly crustaceans and mollusks because they are carnivorous.The term "Loggerhead" refers to the enormous head that houses a powerful set of jaws that are perfect for crushing crustaceans and mollusks. The status of loggerhead turtles was changed to "Endangered".</p>

                      <p>Among all sea turtle species, the leatherback is the largest. They can grow to be longer than 2 meters and often weigh around 600 kg. 918 kg was the weight of the biggest Leatherback ever discovered! They have a primarily black dorsal color with varying amounts of white or lighter markings. Pinkish spots may appear on the neck. The only food source for leatherbacks is jellyfish, and they will travel great distances in quest of their meal.The Leatherback turtle can live in the extreme cold because, unlike other turtles, it can control its own body temperature because layers of fatty tissue insulate its body. They have been spotted feasting on jellyfish in the waters of the Arctic Circle. Their distinctive carapace is what gives them the English name "Leatherback." To find deep-sea jellyfish, leatherback turtles can scuba dive to depths of up to 1500 meters. The Leatherback's body experiences extreme water pressure at these depths, but because of its flexible shell, which resists breaking, the turtle may safely eat. The status of leatherback turtles is currently listed as "Critically Endangered".</p>

                      <p>The adults of hawksbill turtles, which typically weigh around 60 kg and reach lengths of up to 90 cm, are also quite small. They are largely carnivorous and live in tropical coastal waters near coral reefs. They eat a wide range of creatures, such as jellyfish, sponges, and crabs. The English name "hawksbill turtle" refers to the creature's tiny, bird-like beak, which it employs to snare prey that is lurking in small cracks. Hawksbill turtles occasionally consume poisonous sponges. Hawksbills can really store the toxins in their own body rather than getting poisoned. A human who consumes Hawksbill turtle flesh runs the risk of developing severe food illness. Due to centuries of killing of Hawksbill turtles for their shells by people all over the world, their numbers are now critically low.The shell is used to create "tortoiseshell" ornaments once it has been cleaned and polished. Hawksbill turtles are currently categorized as being "Critically Endangered".</p>
