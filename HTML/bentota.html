          <p>What a wonderful and honest project. We have had a great guide through the whole project with nice explanations and informations all about turtles and the project. The turtles that are raised and rescued there from fisher nets are in careful hands. We even had the chance to release 9 baby turtles into the sea.</p>

          <p>The place was grately affected by the Tsunami in 2014 and hasn't recovered. But I'm happy to see how passionate they are about the Turtle research project and that they still help the turtle in the process of hatching and releasing the babies to the open sea. Most of all the sea turtle multiplies in numbers. I'm glad we could support them in our small way.</p>

          <p>The turtle farm is a beautiful place where they farm turtles from hatching and help them grow since most of the different species are endangered and then they are used for educational purposes and released back into the Indian when they are old enough to fend for themselves</p>
