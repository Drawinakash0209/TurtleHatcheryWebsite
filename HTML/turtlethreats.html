        <h2>Threats to Sea Turtles</h2>
        <p>Sea turtles are strong and durable. Since the time of the dinosaurs, they have swum the waters, protected by special body armor from their natural foes. However, in recent times, due to the quickly expanding human population, there have been new, intense pressures that have made it harder for sea turtles to survive. Five primary risks to sea turtles globally have been recognized by the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group: fishing bycatch, coastal development, pollution and infections, direct take, and climate change. Find out more about these threats and how you can assist.</p>

                    <h2>FISHERIES BYCATCH</h2>
                    <p>Thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles are thought to perish each year as a result of the fishing business. Turtles caught in gill nets, trawls, and longlines are discarded as bycatch. Additionally, the disruption to their food supply and environment has an effect on those who are able to evade fishing nets.</p>
                    <div class="bycatch-howtosolve">
                       <p style="color: #6EFFCD;">adjusting the equipment. The simplest first step is to examine the damaging fishing gear that is permitted and replace it with sustainable fishing equipment. Fishing nets' mesh sizes should be increased. Allow only hand-line fishing in place of long-line fishing. creating zones for replenishment and stockpiles. These are places where fishing is prohibited by law. Fish can find sanctuary, a place to grow, and a place to spawn in reserves. Resupply zones should be located next to important fish habitats, including coral reefs. pondering a set period of time during which the fishing will be shut off. Even though many communities may not find this to be sensible, if a fishery is severely depleted, it could need to be closed for a while.</p>

                 <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE
                </h2>
                 <p>We are just now learning the extent to which climate change can affect sea turtles. Climate change can impact the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks, and can escalate the frequency of extreme weather events, which destroy nesting beaches and coral reefs.</p>

                        <dd>The greatest solution to quit using fossil fuels is to switch to clean, renewable energy as our primary energy source. These include innovations in geothermal, wave, wave, tidal, and wind energy.</dd>
                        <dt>Switch to sustainable transport.</dt>
                        <dd>Fossil fuels are used in petrol and diesel automobiles, airplanes, and ships. Air pollution will be decreased as a result of cutting back on flying, moving to electric vehicles, and reducing car use.</dd>
                        <dt>Improve farming and encourage vegan diets. </dt>
                        <dd>Reduced meat and dairy consumption or turning vegan entirely are two of the best methods for people to combat climate change. To assist people in the transition, businesses and food retailers can enhance farming techniques and offer more plant-based goods.</dd>

                <h2>Pollution and pathogens</h2>
                <p>Sea turtles are harmed by marine pollution in a number of ways. Sea turtles are harmed by ingesting and being entangled in waste such as plastic trash, fishing gear left out to sea, petroleum byproducts, and other objects. The immune systems of the turtles may be weakened by ocean pollution, which may also interfere with nesting habits and hatchling orientation.</p>
            <div class="pol-Path">
                <dl>
                    <dt>Use fewer plastics.</dt>
                    <dd>Due to the fact that many ocean plastics might take thousands of years to degrade properly, plastic pollution accounts for a sizable amount of the debris in the ocean. Reduce the amount of plastic products you use in your house, from food storage to plastic bags, to help stop plastic garbage from entering the ocean. Choose quicker-decomposing materials like glass, metal, or environmentally friendly bamboo.</dd>
                    <dt>Opt for multi-use products</dt>
                    <dd>The primary causes of ocean pollution are single-use plastic and paper products like straws, paper towels, plastic bottles, and cutlery. The amount of waste you produce with each meal can be decreased by substituting these things for items that double as many uses, such as cloth napkins or metal cutlery. Maintain a supply of your own reusable water bottles rather than purchasing new ones from the supermarket.</dd>
                    <dt>Recycle</dt>
                    <dd>Recycling is the act of turning used materials into new ones, keeping garbage out of landfills, gutters, and trash cans where it could be carried to the ocean by wind or water. For a list of recyclables that are acceptable in your area, get in touch with the waste management or recycling facility there.</dd>

                <h2>DIRECT TAKE</h2>
                <p>Turtles are murdered all over the world and sold as unusual food, oil, leather, and jewelry on the international market. Millions of hawkbill turtles alone have been slaughtered over the past century only for the value of their shells. Even while efforts to promote conservation have resulted in a decline in the global trade in luxury and handicrafts, turtles continue to face danger in some regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
            <div class="direct-take">
                <p>Around the world, sea turtles are killed for food and for profit, both officially and illegally. The unlawful international trade of turtle products poses a serious threat to sea turtles in general and hawksbills in particular. The consumer market for sea turtle items can be eliminated with the aid of all of us.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>DON’T CONSUME OR PURCHASE SEA TURTLE PRODUCTS</dt>
                    <dd>Many people are startled to hear that jewelry, souvenirs, and other products are still frequently made from tortoiseshell (from the hawksbill turtle) and marketed to visitors, particularly in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Asia. Make no mistake, tortoiseshell cannot be obtained from sustainable sources, so these products must always be avoided. When traveling, make cautious to avoid anything made of tortoiseshell by learning how to identify it. Please report any tortoiseshell items you find.</dd>

                    <dd>When planning your next beach vacation, choose to stay at a hotel or resort that is working to protect its surrounding environment. If traveling to a sea turtle nesting area, confirm that the establishment has taken the steps necessary to ensure the safety of nesting females, nests, and hatchlings. Do they turn lights off in the evening? Instruct guests on proper observation behavior? Support or partner with a beach monitoring program? If not, tell them to; if so, let them know how much you appreciate it.</dd>

    <h2>Bentota and Kosgoda</h2>
    <p>The Turtle Hatcheries at Kosgoda and Bentota are well-known establishments in Sri Lanka dedicated to the preservation and protection 
        of turtles. These hatcheries play a critical role in preserving the long-term survival of these amazing animals. When a turtle is hurt or in distress, they rescue and care for it, restoring its health before releasing it into the ocean when it is deemed ready. Additionally, these hatcheries actively take part in teaching programs designed to raise public awareness of 
        the value of turtle conservation and to advance environmentally friendly methods that will protect the turtles' natural habitats.</p>
