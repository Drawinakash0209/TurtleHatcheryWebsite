    <div class="about-hikkaduwa">
        <p>The Sea Turtle Hatchery and Rescue Center, which aims to preserve some of the world's endangered turtle species, is located a few kilometers north of the main Hikkaduwa town. The southern shore of the island is home to a number of turtle hatcheries, including this one. It began as a community initiative to help safeguard the southern coast's biodiversity, but it has since developed into a full-fledged hatchery and rescue facility with devoted personnel that toil around the clock to study, look after, and safeguard various turtle species.</p>

          <p> The hatchery and rescue facility currently cares for five different species of turtles. These species include the Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and Olive Ridley Turtle. Modern water tanks are included in the facilities at the sea turtle hatchery and rescue center, which also cares for adult turtle species that have been pulled from the water after suffering injuries. The place where the turtles lay their eggs, which has distinct small mounds of sand piled neatly between one another, is one of the more odd sights in the center. The turtle eggs' hatching process is carefully tracked at each of these mounds.</p>

              <p>What a wonderful and honest project. We have had a great guide through the whole project with nice explanations and informations all about turtles and the project. The turtles that are raised and rescued there from fisher nets are in careful hands. We even had the chance to release 9 baby turtles into the sea.</p>

              <p>The place was grately affected by the Tsunami in 2014 and hasn't recovered. But I'm happy to see how passionate they are about the Turtle research project and that they still help the turtle in the process of hatching and releasing the babies to the open sea. Most of all the sea turtle multiplies in numbers. I'm glad we could support them in our small way.</p>

              <p>The turtle farm is a beautiful place where they farm turtles from hatching and help them grow since most of the different species are endangered and then they are used for educational purposes and released back into the Indian when they are old enough to fend for themselves</p>

              <p>Good place with average number of sea turtles. They need to re construct the site bit more. People who handling the site is very friendly.</p>
