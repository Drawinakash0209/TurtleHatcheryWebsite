        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>In Kosgoda, a coastal town in Sri Lanka, there is a well-known turtle conservation initiative called the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. It was created with the intention of safeguarding the habitats of threatened sea turtle species. The hatchery actively promotes the value of sea turtle conservation and engages in a number of initiatives to guarantee the survival of these lovely animals.</p>
      <p>The sea turtle species that are native to Sri Lanka's coastline are preserved in large part because to the hatchery. These species include the Olive Ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), the Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), the Green turtle (Chelonia mydas), and the Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta). The hatchery works ceaselessly to reduce the risks that these turtles face, including habitat degradation, poaching, and unintentional entanglement in fishing nets.</p>
      <p>Protecting sea turtle eggs and ensuring their successful hatching is one of the key goals of the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. During the nesting season, locals and volunteers patrol the neighboring beaches, identifying and gathering turtle eggs to stop them from being stolen or destroyed. In order to increase their chances of survival, the eggs are then carefully transferred to the hatchery where they are nurtured in a controlled environment.</p>
      <p>Overall, Sri Lankan marine turtles can find hope at the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. By working tirelessly, they not only ensure the survival of these threatened species but also serve as role models for others who want to support marine conservation.</p>

        <h1 id="Facilities">Facilities</h1>
        <p>In order to assist its conservation efforts and give sea turtles the best care possible, the Bentota Turtle Hatchery provides a variety of facilities and equipment. The hatchery offers the following important amenities:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Hatchery Tanks: Turtle eggs are incubated in tanks that have been specially made at the hatchery. To guarantee that the eggs successfully hatch, these tanks offer a regulated environment with the right temperature and humidity conditions.</li>
            <li>Pools and Aquariums: The hatchery frequently has aquariums or pools that provide as short-term homes for sick or injured turtles. The hatchery workers can treat and rehabilitate turtles in need before releasing them back into the ocean thanks to these facilities.</li>
            <li>Visitor Center:Most sea turtle hatcheries have a visitor center or a welcome room where tourists and visitors can learn about sea turtles, the hatchery's conservation initiatives, and the current projects. In order to inform and promote awareness about sea turtle conservation, the visitor center may also feature displays, exhibitions, or interactive materials.</li>
            <li>releasing Program:Visitors may have the chance to take part in the releasing of newborn turtles into the ocean as the climax of the hatchery experience. Visitors can participate in conservation initiatives through this program and see the turtles' return to their native environment. </li>

          <p>What a wonderful and honest project. We have had a great guide through the whole project with nice explanations and informations all about turtles and the project. The turtles that are raised and rescued there from fisher nets are in careful hands. We even had the chance to release 9 baby turtles into the sea.</p>

          <p>The place was grately affected by the Tsunami in 2014 and hasn't recovered. But I'm happy to see how passionate they are about the Turtle research project and that they still help the turtle in the process of hatching and releasing the babies to the open sea. Most of all the sea turtle multiplies in numbers. I'm glad we could support them in our small way.</p>

          <p>The turtle farm is a beautiful place where they farm turtles from hatching and help them grow since most of the different species are endangered and then they are used for educational purposes and released back into the Indian when they are old enough to fend for themselves</p>
